    <h3>Cautions</h3>
    
    DO NOT set the script to autorun, while it is designed to be automatic it should not be run unattended. The time for TLC to finish depends on your system specifications; internet speed and amount of pending updates. If you encounter any errors re-running the script after it first stops should correct it :)
